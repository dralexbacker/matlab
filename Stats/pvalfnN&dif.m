function pvalmat = pvalfnN&dif()
% PVALfnN&dif
% Return p-value as a function of the # of experiments N (for N1=N2) & p-diff (0 to 1)
% AB Aug 01
% p-diff is the difference in success probabilities observed under two conditions
%
% PVALMAT is an nxm matrix with p(i,j) indicating the p-value for N=i, p-diff=j.
